## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, a bug in the package search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix. But please reference the issue in the PR description with `closes #<issue number>` to link the PR to the issue and automatically resolves the issue when the PR were merged
